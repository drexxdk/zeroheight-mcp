It typically appears as a compact field that, when activated (e.g., by clicking), expands to reveal a list of choices user can select from. Dropdowns are versatile and particularly useful for saving space and filtering content.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n          UsecasesSaving SpaceWhen you have a moderate to large number of options (typically 5 or more) and need to conserve screen real estate.Presenting a List of ChoicesIdeal for categories, filters, states, countries, date selections (e.g., month, year), or any scenario where users need to pick from a well-defined set of values.Secondary Actions or NavigationSometimes used for \"More options\" menus or navigation lists that are not primary.Filtering and SortingCommon in data tables or search results to refine the displayed content.Anatomy\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nLabelChevronOption VariantsWhen expanded (opened), the dropdowns reveal options. These options are available in different variants, based on whether the dropdown is fulfilling a function of filtering, triggering an action or navigating to a destination.Single choice\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe single choice dropdown consists of options that are mutually exclusive, in between which user can only choose one. Once the user selects one, it will be marked and its function (filtering, sorting, etc. ) will be applied to the affected content. The label of the selected option will then be reflected in the dropdown label. Single choice options can have the following optional properties:counter to visualise how many items are categorised under each optionleading iconMultiple choice\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe multiple choice dropdown consists of options that can be mutually exclusive but can be combined to specify a narrower filtering. The user can any number of options from the dropdown, from none to all available options within the filter. The amount of selected options will be reflected next to the dropdown label (in front of it) and will be shown as a number inside parentheses. Multiple choice options can have the following optional properties:counter to visualise how many items are categorised under each optionleading iconSimple menu\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe simple menu consists of options that are often triggers for specific functionality. This functionality is considered secondary (non-crucial) functionality that expands on the primary functionality of the product. In some cases, the simple menu dropdowns can reveal entrypoints to secondary destinations within the product. Simple menu options can have the following optional properties:leading iconDismissing DropdownClick on the dropdown again once openedClick outside the options when openedPress Esc on a keyboardClick anywhere on the backdrop(overlay)Loading contentWhen waiting for the page content to load, the dropdowns should be in a disabled state to visualise they can not be used until the page content is fully loaded. started the user can not dismiss the modal.Scrolling\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThe content between the Button group and the close button scrolls, so the Button group and the close button are always visible for the userContent GuidelinesDropdown Label Format should be by default <context noun>.If selection has been made:Single choice dropdown - <(1)><context noun> on defaultImperativeFirst word first letter should be capitalAction verb from a list:PrimarySecondaryAfslutBekræftGemGå tilLog indOpretSletStartAnnullerKasserLukOpret (when choice modal)<context noun>First word first letter shouldn’t be capitalOptionalCTA for Info should be always:Primary CTAWith label: OkRelation CTA & Heading[Showing examples like in the proposal Suggestions Copy CTA Modals ] IconsFor widespread and basic actions like e.g. “save” and “delete”, where a global icon standard is established, an icon is put to the left of the label copy in the primary CTA.For our youngest users and those with cognitive challenges, it can be very helpful to support the CTA with an icon. If the technical setup allows it and there is differentiation between primary school users and the rest, an icon may optionally be included in the CTA.An icon CAN be applied even though there is no global icon standard established. It is not a must and should only be done if we can diffenciate between usertypes (eg. primaryscool vs. older students/teachers). Examples of this MUST be part of the UI documentation in the specific product and the designteam needs to showcase the split. AccessibilityScroll lock: While the modal is open, it prevents background content from scrolling. This ensures that users stay focused on the modal content and are not distracted by the page behind it.Focus lock: All keyboard focus is trapped within the modal when it’s open. Users cannot tab outside of the modal’s content. After the modal closes, focus automatically returns to whichever element was last focused before the modal opened.Keyboard: Press Esc to close the modalAria properties: add aria-modal=\"true\" , to indicate the presence of a \"modal\" element to users of assistive technology, meaning navigation is limited to the area itself and the background (the ancestors and siblings of the modal) is hidden.Inert: Add Inert attribute on everything but the modal inert - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN\n        \n        \n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lindhardt og Ringhof Uddannelse ⎮ Design System 2024",
