If the technical setup allows it and there is differentiation between primary school users and the rest, an icon may optionally be included in the CTA.An icon CAN be applied even though there is no global icon standard established. It is not a must and should only be done if we can diffenciate between usertypes (eg. primaryscool vs. older students/teachers). Examples of this MUST be part of the UI documentation in the specific product and the designteam needs to showcase the split. AccessibilityScroll lock: While the modal is open, it prevents background content from scrolling. This ensures that users stay focused on the modal content and are not distracted by the page behind it.Focus lock: All keyboard focus is trapped within the modal when it’s open. Users cannot tab outside of the modal’s content. After the modal closes, focus automatically returns to whichever element was last focused before the modal opened.Keyboard: Press Esc to close the modalAria properties: add aria-modal=\"true\" , to indicate the presence of a \"modal\" element to users of assistive technology, meaning navigation is limited to the area itself and the background (the ancestors and siblings of the modal) is hidden.Inert: Add Inert attribute on everything but the modal inert - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN\n        \n        \n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lindhardt og Ringhof Uddannelse ⎮ Design System 2024",
